                    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
                    <p>This was a project that I had to do during my school days. The fun part of this project was that it was a collaborative project where everyone had to analyze the designer that was chosen and then imitate their style. The designer that was chosen was <a href="http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&q=odermatt+and+tissi" target="_blank">Odermatt & Tissi</a> and their post-modern style.</p>

                        <h3>About the Project</h3>
                    <p>Basically, the only critera for the project was "Stay within the designer's boundaries, and try not to go all over the place." The collaborative part of this project showed that everyone took different styles from Odermatt & Tissi and try to recreate it while mixing one's own colors. There were messes, but beautiful clean messes.</p>
