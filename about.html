        <h2>Background Story</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Thank you for taking an interest upon me. My name is <strong>Jonathan Chen</strong>. I am a designer and developer living in Tokyo, Japan. I specialize in many forms of design, but I primarily focus on Interface design for web, mobile, or anything displayed on screen with a touch of interaction. I'm a lover of good typography and I love all things of beauty. That is why I went to pursue in the artistic and creative industry; I want to design beautiful memories for people. At the same time, I also want to further my technical knowledge in development so that I can create beautiful memories for people.</p>

          <p>I feel that I am on an everlasting journey of knowledge, but I believe this journey will surely bring me enlightenment. I believe design is a problem-solving technique, and that good design, of any form, benefits everyone in some ways. That is my feeling as a designer. I believe being able to create useful experiences will bring the world together. That is my intention as a developer. I wish everyone can all live in perfect harmony. That is my selfish desire as a person. I hope we can design and create something together; please don't hesitate to <a href="contact" title="Contact Jonathan Chen">contact me</a>.</p>
