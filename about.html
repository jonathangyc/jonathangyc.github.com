              <h3>Storyboarding</h3>
              <p>As both a consumer and a maker, I know the importance of being able to imagine who is using your product. User-stories allow myself <em>(and others)</em> to not lose sight of who the design is for.</p>

              <img src="/img/about-wireframing.svg" alt="">
              <h3>Wireframing</h3>
              <p>From low-fi to hi-fi, I've done a lot of wireframes that outlines the basic structure of the user interface for both websites and applications.</p>

              <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
              <p>With so many devices on the market nowadays, I learned to build designs that evolve according to your device. This means desktop, laptop, tablet, and your phone. <em>No more broken layouts!</em></p>

              <h3>Prototyping</h3>
              <p>Having coding knowledge gives me the ability to prototype ideas, whether it's for interactivity or just getting a general feel of the design.</p>

              <img src="/img/about-communicating.svg" alt="">
              <h3>Communicating</h3>
              <p>I always try to talk with my users, clients, or anyone. This may seem obvious, but I believe without constant communication, things get lost-in-translation and misunderstandings happen.</p>

              <img src="/img/about-gaming.svg" alt="">
              <h3>Gaming</h3>
              <p>A hobby of mine which trains me to problem solve within a time limit, how to survive under pressure, and all around a good stress reliever.</p>
