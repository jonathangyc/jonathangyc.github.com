				<h2>London Metro Dance Party</h2>
				<p>London Metro Dance Party is a community-themed poster. It was a project where we had to choose a designer of choice and imitate their style. The designer that was chosen was <a href="http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&q=odermatt+and+tissi" target="_blank" class="targetblank">Odermatt &amp; Tissi</a> and their post-modern style. I really liked their use of colors and typography.</p>
