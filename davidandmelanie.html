                    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
                    <p>Well, this was interesting. My brother and sister-in-law asked me to help out with their wedding stuff. Such as coming up with a logo that matched their wedding theme. And also, designing the invitation postcard, envelope, and little bits &amp; pieces. Fun experience helping them out. Here's to a happily ever after.</p>

                        <h3>The Invitation</h3>
                        <p>Not much to say for this one actually. I was going for a bit of that vintage / Victorian-era feel with the invitation on this one with a focus on typography. Their theme for their wedding was the Cotton Flower, which influenced quite a bit in terms of the colors, logo, and general direction for the design.</p>
